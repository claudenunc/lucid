# Missing Components and Connections Analysis

After analyzing the repository content, database schema, and React components, I've identified several missing components and connections that need to be implemented to create a fully functional lucid dreaming application.

## Missing Components

1. **Dream Context Provider**
   - The components reference a `useDreamContext` hook, but the actual context provider is missing
   - Need to implement the Dream Context to manage global state

2. **Authentication Components**
   - Login form
   - Registration form
   - Password reset functionality
   - User profile management

3. **Navigation Components**
   - Main navigation menu
   - User dashboard layout

4. **Dream Journal List View**
   - Component to display a list of dream journal entries
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities

5. **Practice Session Components**
   - Interface for starting and tracking practice sessions
   - Session history view

6. **Progress Tracking Visualization**
   - Charts or graphs to visualize lucidity progress
   - Statistics dashboard

7. **Audio Resource Library**
   - Component to browse and select audio resources
   - Categorization by protocol type

## Missing Connections

1. **API Integration**
   - API client for connecting to backend services
   - CRUD operations for dream journals, practice sessions, etc.

2. **Database Connection**
   - Implementation of database queries based on SQL schema
   - Data fetching and state management

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - User session management
   - Protected routes

4. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - Mobile-first approach mentioned in project structure
   - Responsive layout components

## Implementation Priorities

1. Dream Context Provider (highest priority)
2. Basic navigation and layout components
3. Dream Journal functionality (entry creation and listing)
4. Authentication components
5. Practice Session components
6. Progress tracking visualization
7. Audio resource library

This analysis will guide the implementation of additional functionality in the next steps.
